Gear2D Android project
----------------------

This project aims to be the initial setup and example needed to build
and run android projects using Gear2D.

You'll need the android-ndk installed. Refer to your package manager
on instructions of how to install it.

Go to the folder jni/ and clone gear2d and gear2d-components repository:

  cd jni && git clone http://github.com/Gear2D/gear2d
  cd jni && git clone http://github.com/Gear2D/gear2d-components

They will have build rules for themselves for android.

Enter jni folder and run ndk-build. It will build (slightly modifed versions of)
SDL2, SDL2_mixer, SDL2_image and others.

Later, running ant debug will create an debug apk of your app. If you have
your device connected, you can install it by typing.
adb install bin/YourApp-debug.apk

Creating entities
-----------------
Look at assets/ folder. There you create entities and put your assets like
musics and images. You can create subfolders there and reference them in your
entities' yaml file.

Creating new components
-----------------------

The folder jni/logo contains a component named logo that displays the
blood/smile animation. You can use it and its folder structure to create
new components. No changes are needed in Android.mk if your component is
not very complex (i.e, doesn't depend on a lot of stuff).

After that, open src/Android.mk and change LOCAL_WHOLE_STATIC_LIBRARIES and
add the name of your component there. It'll be statically compiled and linked
into the final library.

Change the application icon and name
------------------------------------

Open build.xml, change <project name="Gear2D" default="help"> to whatever
name you want your apk file to have.

Open AndroidManifest.xml. Change the <activitiy android:name="Gear2D" line
to whatever you want the name of your application to be.

It is recommended to follow instrunctions on that file to change your package name
so it does not collides with another apps.

Go to res/drawable. The file ic_launcher.png is the icon to your application. Change it at will.
